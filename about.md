## About

I don't actually know me well. Sometimes I think I am a generous person with a good heart.
But some people remind me how envious is my mind!! I think I am just a lonely person, having no one to talk, having no money either. Seem to appear in shabby cloths with a messed up hair. Have lots of opinion about everything, but have no one to listen to me.
